				<h3>Mohandas karamchand Gandhi</h3>
				<p>
					(1869-1948) was one of the few men in history to fight simultaneously on moral, religious, political, social, economic, and cultural fronts. During his time as a lawyer in South Africa he developed his strategy of non-violence: the idea of opposing unjust laws by non-violent protest. He led the Indian National Congress party in three major campaigns against British rule, each culminating in his arrest.

					In Gandhi, a short introduction to Gandhi's life and thought, Bhikhu Parekh outlines both Gandhi's major philosophical insights and the limitations of his thought. Written with extensive access to Gandhi's writings in Indian languages to which most commentators have little or no access, Parekh looks at Gandhi's cosmocentric anthropology,

					his spiritual view of politics, and his theories of oppression, non-violent action, and active citizenship. He also considers how the success of Gandhi's principles were limited by his lack of coherent theories of evil, and of state and power. Gandhi's view of man as ascetic allows no room for expressions of the cultural, artistic, or intellectual. Furthermore,

					<h3>Holy Festival</h3>
					<p class="hidden-xs">
						Holi is the most famous festival of colours. It is celebrated every year in the month of Falgun (March) by the people of Hindu religion. It is celebrated with great joy and enthusiasm as it brings feeling of love and closeness among people.
						 Colourful colours are spread out by the people over each other. At this day we meet each other, handshake, hug and apply abeer on the forehead to each other. We sing religious songs (or Fagua geet) with musical instruments like Dholak, Kirtal, etc. At this special day we eat special things like gujhiya, sweets, chips, papad, halwa, pani puri, dahi bade, etc. A day before the colourful holi, Holika Dahan takes place.
